I am a Ph.D. student at [Florida State University](www.fsu.edu) studying Formal Methods in
the [Computer Science Department](www.cs.fsu.edu) under the guidance of Dr. [Grigory Fedyukovich](http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~grigory/). I began the program in January of 2020.

Our society relies heavily on the use of software. It is in the devices we use everyday, in our vehicles, infrastructure, etc. We expect those systems to function properly with as few problems as possible. As software becomes more complex error checking becomes more difficult. My research will focus on improving the safety of software through the synthesis of inductive invariants.
